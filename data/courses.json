    "description": "Literary historians generally agree that in the 1970s, in the U.S., there was a significant increase in the publication of diverse forms of African American literature. The 1970s is also often described by scholars as a decade in which there was a renaissance of African American women’s writing as well as the publication of several experimental African American literary works. In this seminar, we will study this lively period in African American literary history primarily through novels, some of them recently republished or adapted into other forms. What idea of African American literature do we get when we read novels from this era? What questions were asked in 1970s African American novels that we continue to ask now? Novels we will likely read include detective fiction, diaristic fiction, satirical fiction, a love story, and historical fiction."

    "description": "In African cinema and modern African literature, the genre of the love story is often used by artists as a medium for addressing various socio-political issues. In this seminar, we will discuss African love stories as complex narratives about romantic relationships, as political fiction, and as spaces where African artists reflect on romantic love, romantic desire, and the idea of romance. In what ways do African love stories published in the twentieth century still speak to us today? How do twenty-first century African artists use love stories to confront contemporary societal concerns?"

    "description": "In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, monuments tied to the violent histories of slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy have received renewed interest and debate. Protestors and individuals have defaced, toppled, and petitioned for the removal of Confederate monuments and statues to the white male power elite. This symbolic retributive violence and sometimes ritual care signals a challenge to the long-lived monument. This reading course explores public monuments and the ways in which artists and communities have negotiated history and the politics of memory and remembrance in the United States. We will evaluate the meaning and purpose of monuments that define American public spaces, investigating the problematic narratives and historic controversies surrounding such objects. The removal of monuments asks us to question whose histories have been forgotten, ignored, or suppressed, and what monumental justice might look like."

    "description": "The course introduces students to the Black Arts Movement (BAM), an era from approx. 1965-1975 of politically charged, socially relevant art making designed to uncover, liberate, connect, and transform Black people. BAM artists used ritual, poetry, music, song, dance, and theatre to identify, disrupt, and examine human thought and action that produced and sustained racism, poverty, colonialism, and sexism. In our class, students will study BAM manifestos, poetry, and plays designed to transform audiences. These course readings will be augmented by regular, on-your-feet, interactive workshops in BAM performance techniques such as improvisational theatre, agit-prop, and the choreopoem. Along the way, we will also dive into the origins of Brown’s own Rites & Reason Theatre (est. 1971), and the importance of community-engaged participant research in the African American theatre tradition."

This course relies on this question to foreground two important elements within the Black Digital Humanities (Black DH). First, Black scholarly approaches to the impact of technology on and in Black life and vice versa. Second, Black scholarly explorations of Black digital life and expertise. We will take a broad approach to Black DH, thinking generally about the transformative interplay between Blackness and digital technology, the extent to which digital projects can “recover” Black histories within the archive, and methodological approaches to the study of tech and digital life within Black Studies. Drawing on Black epistemologies, students will analyze digital technologies to propose new and different questions about how Blackness both (re)shapes technology and the “human” in the humanities."

    "description": "Over the past several years there has been much public discussion about systemic racism, and its role in perpetuating racial inequality. What is systemic racism? What role does it play in society and how have African Americans responded to it? This course will use the lens of “systemic racism” to explore the interconnections between policies and practices that create a network of devastating forms of racial discrimination and disadvantage; conditions that have shifted over time and have made it difficult for black communities, and individuals within them, to flourish. And yet, systemic racism does not have the final word. We will also consider how African-American communities have developed various modes of resilience in cultural, spiritual/religious, artistic, and other facets of life."

Reading narratives from a select group of instances, we will explore, against the broader theoretical work on global revolutions, the more specific meaning of revolution in Africana history and literature. The overriding question is, in the face of disappointing outcomes, tragedy and collapse, can the history of Black revolt and revolution still provide a framework for thinking about radical change in the 21st Century, or should we move beyond it?"

Challenging the Freudian supposition that all human beings are sexual subjects, we will think critically about naturalized assumptions regarding sex, intimacy, attraction, and desire, opening up new frameworks, orientations, and language informed by queer and feminist discourse. We will engage sex as a form of political power whose influence extends far beyond the act of heterosexual intercourse itself, pervading and organizing our everyday lives along the lines of race, gender, ability, class, and religion. Texts will draw upon queer and feminist theory, cultural studies, disability studies, feminist science and technology studies, gender and sexuality studies, and popular culture."

We will learn from theorists, writers, and artists including Audre Lorde, Cathy Cohen, E. Patrick Johnson, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Danez Smith, Janelle Monae, among many others."

Taking our cue from Driftpile Cree poet Billy-Ray Belcourt, we will question the ways in which the “grammar of Indigenous Studies misapprehends the tumult of everyday life” through the field’s emphasis on sovereignty and political recognition. We will trace a colonial history that has made categories such as “the human” and “the subject” unavailable to Native people, and consider the affective conditions created for individuals living within a state made possible only through their elimination. What lives do Native people forge despite the confines that settler colonialism carves for them? How might we better understand these lives through Native literature?"

With a particular focus on social movements, we will examine the circumstances under which people politically mobilize understandings of gender and sexuality, and how these mobilizations relate to issues like marginalization, migration, colonialism, and capitalism.

Both are grounded in the anthropological sub-disciplines of biological anthropology and archaeology. The focus in bioarchaeology is advancing our understanding of the human experience in the past. Bioarchaeologists study a range of topics including health, violence, migration, and embodiment. Forensic anthropology is a form of applied anthropology that is employed to document and interpret human remains in medico-legal contexts. The course will survey both fields while instructing in the methodologies and approaches of each. The course complements The Human Skeleton (ANTH 1720)."

Where do archaeology and history contribute to the ossification and legitimation of culinary traditions and practices? There are many stakes tied to such questions—nutritional, religious, ethnic, institutional, governmental, and touristic, among others. In this course, we address relationships between food history and gastronomic heritage, drawing on examples from around the world and across media, including cookbooks, international policy reports, and video game representations. We examine culinary dimensions considered \"traditional\" by local communities and federal agencies, the archaeological and historical sources of such narratives (if they exist), and impacts of gastronomic heritage on modern practices, identities, and economies."

However, imperial formations are strikingly diverse, and many of the entities that scholars now call “empires” were not understood as such during their own times. This collaborative humanities graduate seminar explores that diversity and examines how empires rise, fall, and perdure. While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples' relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture."

It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800."

    "description": "There has been an explosion of interest in how to present information in a visual way rather than as a bunch of boring numbers. Visualizations can be outstanding at conveying information, but there have also been colossal failures. We will explore the good, the bad, and the ugly and harness knowledge of visual perception to understand why some are more successful than others. Someone interested in how to create effective visual displays (posters, infographics) would benefit from this course. Some background in visual perception is recommended such as a CLPS or NEUR course about vision or familiarity with graphic design."

The human mind strives to resolve the competing pressures of self-interest against the greater good. By drawing upon many disciplines including philosophy, social and affective neuroscience, abnormal psychology, law, and experimental economics, this course covers topics from 18th-century philosophy to modern-day neuroscience. We will examine 1) the philosophical and epistemological foundations of moral thought, 2) the influence of emotion and contextual framing on moral action, 3) the psychopathology of immoral choice, and 4) the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that guide moral decision-making. Registration for this course will be determined by the faculty on the first day of class. The final class list is determined by 1) some working knowledge in cognitive neuroscience (evidence by taking at least 1 prior class in the concentration), 2) who shows up to the first class, 3) the student's year (seniority is prioritized) and 4) when people emailed the faculty member to get on the class list."

How did literature contribute to the formation of the Third-Worldist project, and how did the Third-Worldist project inform the writing of literature? We will approach these questions by examining the role of conferences, print periodicals, and supranational organizations like the Afro-Asian Writers Association in shaping new understandings of the politicized function of literature.

Through a sampling of poetry, narrative, and film, we will explore the uneven terrain of the Anthropocene, in which the feedback loops of race, class, gender, and other forms of social difference, along with geography itself, continue to separate humans, even as evidence mounts for the inseparability of humans from the rest of the planet, including its nonhuman inhabitants.

Why did Chinese politicians see the reform of family and gender relations as central to their larger political goals? What were the “new” gender relations supposed to be? How was gender reform carried out (or not) and what were its effects, intended and unintended?"

What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back? This course introduces students to critical film and media analysis through a feminist lens. Focusing on the work of Asian women, we explore feminist film theory, beginning with Laura Mulvey’s 1970s analysis and extending through contributions that have enriched and challenged it. The first unit examines canonical feminist film theory texts on the gaze, representation, and feminist reading practices, paired with global films to assess their ongoing relevance. The second unit focuses on contemporary Asian women’s films that challenge norms, expanding our understanding of feminist film theory’s major themes and issues."

    "description": "Over the past several decades, the field of finance has developed a successful paradigm based on the notions that investors and managers are generally rational and that the prices of securities are generally “efficient.” In recent years, however, theoretical and empirical research has shown this paradigm to be insufficient in describing the various features of actual financial markets. In this course we will examine how the insights of behavioral finance complement the traditional paradigm and shed light on the behavior of asset prices, corporate finance, financial crises, and other phenomena."

It examines: (i) the determinants of the growth process since the emergence of Homo sapiens, (ii) the roots of the dramatic transformation in living standards in the past two centuries, and (iii) the role of deeply rooted geographical, institutional, and cultural characteristics as well as human diversity in the uneven development across the countries and regions. The analysis proposes a resolution for some of the most fundamental mysteries of the journey of humanity: What trapped humankind in poverty for most of human existence? What sparked the massive metamorphosis in living standards over the past two centuries? And what led to the emergence of immense inequality across nations?"

Over the past two decades, a vast research program aimed at measuring household, firms and policymaker beliefs using numerous data sources, including surveys, asset prices and controlled experiments. By dint of this effort, we have invaluable data that can be used to evaluate alternative theories of expectations formation and their implications for macroeconomics and finance. While a growing body of evidence has documented many deviations from the simple rational benchmark, it has not yet resulted in a widely accepted alternative modeling paradigm. In this course we review different theories of expectations’ formation and confront their predictions with empirical evidence. Lastly, we evaluate the implications of different expectations formation mechanisms for business cycles, asset prices and for the design of monetary policy."

    "description": "An introduction to coastal and estuarine oceanography, focusing on ocean environments landward of the continental shelf/slope break. These environments are of significant value, both environmentally and economically. They are under pressure and strongly impacted by human activities, both directly (e.g. commercial fishing) and indirectly (urbanization within the adjacent river drainage basins). The extent to which these waters continue to be economically valuable is intimately linked to their environmental health. As such, an understanding of coastal and estuarine processes is critical to their management. This course will address the coastal and estuarine circulation context as well as the environmental context. Coastal and estuarine oceanography will be addressed in class lectures, discussions, and exercises while the environmental concerns will be addressed in the context of individual student research projects culminating in a research paper and in-class presentation."

How do imagined lands comment upon our own? What freedoms and possibilities arise from the ability to imagine alternative worlds?"

    "description": "Why does the English department require concentrators to take one course covering writing before the year 1700? What's so magical about 1700? What's so special about literature before that date? The word “literature” in its modern sense doesn’t even emerge until the 18th century (at the earliest). So is what we’re reading when we read pre-1700 material even literature? We'll survey some writing produced--wait for it--before 1700, consider why we're doing so and whether such a requirement makes sense, and read some material about the function and value of the study of literature in English in the first place. Authors may include William Shakespeare, Anne Bradstreet, John Milton, and Aphra Behn."

    "description": "Communication is a vital component of effective collaboration. In this 4-week course, students learn how the extended human-centered design process can apply and be implemented by graphical and language-based communication for different audiences. Beginning with exercises framing the challenge of identifying and engaging different audiences, students will consider the broad variety of design engineering audiences and their information consumption and dissemination behaviors. Identify, adapt and create appropriate communication strategies for a variety of objectives and contexts, such as individual inquiry, eliciting feedback or engaging support. Students teach each other, bringing tools and approaches from their disciplinary homes to this shared endeavor. This studio transitions discussions of effective communication to drafting the Capstone Studio proposal. Initial drafts are used as the basis for learning; they are developed and transformed from detailed statements of interest to a group proposal for all participants."

    "description": "In this course, we will immerse ourselves in the academic field of Indigenous Gender and Sexuality Studies. While in Western societies gender and sexuality have traditionally been employed as tools of population control—becoming associated with ideas like sin, shame, and the private—in this course we will approach them as good medicine. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of Indigenous scholars, artists, and activists, we will explore the healing power of gender and sexual diversity. All throughout the course, we will also learn about the fight of Indigenous peoples to reclaim sovereignty over their own bodies. In this sense, we will approach Indigenous gender and sexuality as active tools for decolonization. While the course’s primary geographic focus is Anglo-North America—with a specific emphasis in the United States—it aims to be hemispheric (and global) in its approach."

We seek to understand how dilemmas over and struggles for belonging and equality in the United States have played out in and over urban and suburban spaces. We will pay particular attention to the histories of segregation, housing discrimination, urban unrest, suburban integration, the rise of “ethnoburbs,” and gentrification. Readings represent foundational texts and new directions in scholarship and provide in-depth examinations of particular urban and suburban communities. Topics include the simultaneous erasure and appropriation of Indigenous peoples in the development of Pacific Northwest cities; the Asian American “model minority” and integration of all-white suburbs; minority grassroots activism and resistance against redevelopment; racism and neoliberal urban governance in the 21st century.

The decisive influence of figures such as Kojève and Sartre, both readers of Hegel in France, will be the starting point for understanding authors such as Fanon, Foucault and Derrida in a political and theoretical context marked by Marxism. We will then look at the most contemporary metamorphoses in Francophone thought, notably the centrality of political ecology and decolonial theories. TAUGHT IN FRENCH"

Everywhere, the barriers to women’s economic engagement reach beyond work and salary to encompass property ownership, capital, credit, and markets. When considered as a whole, these barriers constitute economic exclusion, not just economic inequality. To date, policy, scholarship, and activism on the economic status of women have tended to focus on inequality in the formal workplace, but the full pattern is much more visible when women-owned businesses are examined."

GBV is violence that either targets people because of their perceived/actual gender identity (cis women, transgender people, non-binary people and others) or disproportionately impacts people with minoritized gender identities. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to GBV prevention, grounded in public health but drawing on scholarship from gender and sexuality studies and related fields (social work, legal studies, and others). It does this as a means of both broadening and critiquing the way public health frames GBV. This CBLR-designated course requires students to participate in a team project grounded in community: teams will conduct community-based qualitative research and give a presentation on gender-based violence in the college population that will fill a knowledge gap at a community agency."

We will closely analyze black feminist theory alongside a wide-ranging survey of significant painting, sculpture, performance, photography, and installation art made by black women in the 19th to 21st centuries. Theoretical concepts representing the singular modes of dispossession that ensnare black femininity, as well as black femininity's re/production of the modern world—concepts such as black flesh, ungendering, fungibility, black mater, plasticity—will be applied to analysis of artworks and the artworks will in turn flesh out these concepts. We will utilize close textual analysis, visual analysis, and art historical context to interrogate the ways that black female artists illuminate, critique, and intervene on hegemonic constructions of gender and sexuality and art historical ideologies."

This course introduces students to experimental ethnographies that take place in environments where the boundaries between water and land get blurred in deltas, river embankments, swamps, mangroves, and reclamation areas that carry signs of both enabling and challenging former and continuing colonial projects of empire or capital. We will critically read and examine ethnographic works that tackle “wetness” and “fluidity” as theoretical tools for understanding fluidity, circulation, and flow to challenge linear development projects from a feminist ethnographic perspective. The course will focus on practicing attunement to more than human life and materialities of soil, water, and land/seascape through experimental ethnographic methods."

The challenge that deep time poses to the human imagination has grown more urgent to address in light of our current environmental crisis. What can the humanities teach us about deep time? We will approach this question in three ways: 1) by looking beyond conceptions of space as female and passive and foregrounding non-binarized conceptions of space that are agentive and dynamic, 2) by examining human and non-human relationships in diverse cultural traditions, and 3) by considering how artists and writers worldwide create their own scales of deep time and inscribe rhythms of human and non-human life into their works.

How might scholars working on gender/sexuality acknowledge disciplinary boundaries and use disciplinary training effectively? We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-à-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies."

What are the ways to trace the presences and absences of the colonial Anthropocene? How do we write, visualize, engage with the disappeared and extinct, but also the processes of metamorphosis, metabolics, desire, and queer and trans ecologies that are entangled with anthropogenic crisis? How do the elements of environmental writing underscore the means by which to enliven forms of care, repair, and belonging towards a post-extractive world? We attend to Indigenous, Africana, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Global South perspectives, modes of narration, visuality and experimentation asking throughout how gender and sexuality shift what we know and how we write about it. Through refining our literary and visual arts, frequencies, and embodied engagements, we address collective practices that erode and unwrite the Anthropocene."

There will be readings of modern essays on different aspects (language, meter, historical background, theatrical performances, literary interpretations, etc.) of this play and of Aristophanes’ production."

In German-language literature, political models of society, psychological theories on the dynamics of thinking and feeling, and critical discussions of history are often negotiated on the basis of an outline of what childhood is. This is because studying how humans develop promises to provide insight into what it means to be human and permits one to construct images of how humans should live. This line of thought breaks from a centuries-old convention of equating children with animals due to their lack of articulate speech and regretting this phase. In this course, we will read key texts of German-language literature from the Enlightenment to the present day that expound childhood as a special, formative epoch of individual life that, at the same time, grants insight into social dynamics."

Almost 50 years later, Jacob Grimm delivers a lecture under a similar yet slightly––and decisively––different title: Das Wort des Besitzes, dealing not only with the history and semantics of the word Besitz but with the word itself. His lecture transforms a juridical question into a linguistic one: how is it possible (and is it possible at all) to possess a word? In other words: to turn a language into one’s own in order to possess it? The seminar will discuss aspects of this question in legal, philosophical, political, linguistic, and literary texts by (among others) Rousseau, Kant, Babeuf, Proudhon, Hölderlin, Kleist, Hebel, Marx, and Kafka.–– Senior Seminar."

The more one thinks about the moment, the more inscrutable it appears. Seemingly the most basic of experiences, the moment remains nevertheless shrouded in darkness, as already Plato, in the late dialogue Parmenides, worried. Our seminar will examine the “darkness of the lived moment,” as Ernst Bloch, the great political philosopher of hope, named it. What appears in the immediacy of our experience, is actually far removed from our understanding, but it does open onto an unforeclosed futurity. We will contemplate this darkness of the lived moment in a constellation of works drawn from literature and the arts; and in relation to theoretical texts by such thinkers as Bloch, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, and Blanchot."

However, at least with the end of the Cold War, national German memory culture has also been challenged by non-national perspectives, especially by the necessity to commemorate the entanglement of National Socialism with Communist totalitarianisms and to situate German memory culture within a Central and Eastern European context. To engage with this tension, we will read theoretical texts that continue to inform current memory debates (Arendt, Mitscherlich), recent social sciences approaches to transgenerational transmissions of psycho-social sequelae of perpetration and complicity (Welzer & al., Mihai, Gobodo-Madikizela), and literary texts that have brought transgenerational transmissions into the focus of public attention (Bernhard, Sebald), in order then to focus on contemporary German-language texts that negotiate the difficulties of commemorating totalitarianisms."

While each country had to contend with its own history and particularities, from the Lavender Scare to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo notions and anxieties about gender and sexuality appear as a connecting thread of regional conflict. In this course, we will examine how ideas about gender were a central battleground for the political transformation of the region. We will consider how states and institutions employed conservative gender ideologies as avenues of political and individual control, while shifting ideas about gender also served as avenues for the activation of new political subjects.

We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself. Equally, we zoom in on the regular contestation and even outright rebellion that this transcontinental polity inspired. This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean, and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. We will track the making and unmaking of the British Empire by studying the evolution of global trade, labor regimes including slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, as well as new ideas about governance, race, and identity."

    "description": "Before the Spanish invaded in the 1530s, western South America was the scene of the largest state the New World had ever known, Tawantinsuyu, the Inca empire. During almost 300 years of colonial rule, the Andean provinces were shared by the \"Republic of Spaniards\" and the \"Republic of Indians\" - two separate societies, one dominating and exploiting the other. Today the region remains in many ways colonial, as Quechua- and Aymara-speaking villagers face a Spanish-speaking state, as well as an ever-more-integrated world market, the pressures of neoliberal reform from international banks, and the melting of the Andean glaciers."

    "description": "This course is centered around the relationship between history and storytelling. It takes as a starting point that history is itself political, and asks that we always consider both how and why we tell stories about the past. Together, we will critically examine a broad range of films and texts that engage with the Latin American past, and explore what they have to say about how gender and sexuality, imperialism, slavery, the church, revolution and repression shaped the region. How do films represent the past, and how do we approach “historical film”? How have narrative and documentary films been used as in various social and political struggles? Each week, we will examine documentary, narrative, or experimental films in relation to other modes of historical storytelling, from academic historiography to graphic novels, first person testimonios, memoirs, oral histories, and journalism."

    "description": "The Ottoman Empire (1299—1923) was the longest-lived and most powerful Islamicate dynasty in history. From nomadic Turkic warriors in Asia to multiethnic empire straddling three continents, the Ottomans became the premier power in the Mediterranean world and the last to single-handedly govern most of today’s Middle East/MENA. Yet, Ottoman formation and evolution—fusing Roman, Mongol, and Persianate imperial heritages, as well as Muslim, Christian, and Jewish faith communities—remain little understood. This course explores West Asia, Southern Europe, and North Africa through the prism of Ottoman history from medieval beginnings to modern legacies, including those surviving Ottoman partition after WWI. We shall engage difficult questions surrounding law and empire, religion and secularism, nationalism and state-building, and the legacies of Ottoman rule in and outside today’s Turkey—from Bosnia to Baghdad, Ukraine to Yemen, and “where East meets West”: Constantinople/Istanbul."

These changes were crucial to the conceptions of women and their place in society that shaped the modern feminist movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Throughout the course we will be thinking about gender relations as relationships of power: about how power was gendered in political, economic, social, and cultural institutions and spheres; and about how the intersection of gender with class, religious belief, and medicine shaped power relationships. We will also be particularly attentive to women’s participation in these power relationships—that is, the ways in which they could (and did) reinforce, manipulate, exploit, subvert, or resist them."

The solutions found have ranged from inclusion on equal terms through exclusion not only from society but from humanity altogether.

Together, we will explore ways of thinking about disease and public health as topics of historical inquiry, and examine how health politics have been shaped by processes of imperialism, sexuality, and racial inequality. From nineteenth-century obstetrical experiments on enslaved women, to more recent debates over the disease threat posed by Haitians during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, race and sexuality have both shaped the development of medical knowledge and been used to isolate certain groups as threats. Social concerns over women’s bodies and reproductive capacities have also shaped medical research and public health policy across the hemisphere. Through shared readings and guided independent research, this course gives students an opportunity to explore a wide variety of topics related to the history of medicine, race, and gender."

Who decided it? What were the effects of this process? How did changes in the pastoral methods and devotional culture during the Spanish domination reflect opposing visions of colonial society? The course explores how these imported religious expressions and their local variations served the different social groups that formed New Spain’s colonial society to negotiate their place in a fluctuating social order and legitimize their struggle for political, economic, and symbolic power. Although mainly focused on Indigenous agency and native conceptions of Christian religion, the course also addresses the agency of Afro-descendants, the emergence of afro-catholic identities, and the intersection between religious identities, race, and gender in daily life and public imagination.P"

Assuming no prior knowledge of the region, this course offers an in-depth introduction to the political trajectory of Tibet’s relation with China from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. Yet, at the same time as Tibet was subsumed into a political unit within China, Tibetan Buddhism as a religious ideology continued to spread across both the Himalayan regions of Nepal and Northern India as well as Mongolia. This course explores how Buddhist knowledge systems and cosmologies continue to interact with contemporary themes of modernity, secularism, and nationalism in East/South Asia."

This seminar places contemporary discourse about automation in historical context, underscoring how the promises and threats of labor automation are not nearly as new as they seem. Focusing on workers’ perspectives on automation, as well as their attempts to resist it, this course will highlight the unequal experience of automation across geographic, gendered and racialized hierarchies. Considering both micro-level changes in workplaces and global dynamics, we’ll ask: How did textile workers in Bursa and colonial Bombay, tobacco workers in Lebanon, and autoworkers in the United States articulate and act on fears that their labor would become obsolete? And how might colonialism, migration, the offshoring of jobs and the informalization of labor in the Global South be tied to the automation of labor in the Global North?"

While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples’ relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture."

    "description": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have produced systems that can appear human-level in their ability to generate text and images. This technology opens questions concerning the relationships between the art and philosophy of language and computation as cultural infrastructure. This seminar will explore how technology and humans interact via language, and what it means for humans and for AI to read and to write. The format of this collaborative humanities seminar will emphasize in-class discussion. Readings will comprise a mix of literature, including digital literature, theory, and philosophy of language. Participants will not be required to have a background in computer science or technology, but will experience tutorials on key technical concepts in order to enable them to think critically about cutting-edge developments in AI beyond a superficial level."

Metals are conveyors of powers, and are seated in pre-colonial mythologies, cosmologies, and ways of being in the world. In this collaborative theory/praxis course we ask with others (Walter Rodney, Eduardo Galeano, or Guamán Poma) how these can be reclaimed through the exercise of the gestures and techniques of below-the-ground materials. What would it mean practically to overturn the histories of plunder, theft, and evacuation and imagine beyond them? A central aspect of the course is to make and visit jewelry as immanent to social and spiritual fabrics. We acknowledge the presences and excesses of the materials we work with and engage these objects beyond the colonial and monocultural imagination."

These forms will be explored as pertaining to politics, theology, art, and experience. The work will be theoretical and hermeneutic; it will involve theoretical texts in political and critical theory and political theology, literary works, and films. We will explore time from the perspective of (its) ending. We will be interested in the prospect — whether a menace or a blessing — of a coming end, but also with the power and authority to bring an end, to an argument, to waiting in line, to a relationship, to life. We will study the power to suspend a coming end and the life under its shadow."

Yet, despite many advances in the field, the world is more dangerous than ever, and vulnerable civilians are increasingly threatened by a multitude of challenges including war, climate change, pandemics, natural disasters, the erosion of humanitarian and human rights law, and rapid advances in world-changing technologies. How do global issues such as climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence, and migration impact human security? In what ways do social, economic, environmental, and political factors intersect in the context of human security? What ethical considerations should be considered when reimagining approaches to human security?"

This course first examines how China transitioned from a planned economy to a “socialist market economy,” then turns to how the “socialist market economy” has functioned in practice. By examining the key factors of production—land, labor, capital, and information—this course shows how the Chinese state retains the ability to set prices and allocate inputs across different sectors of the economy, facilitating the implementation of industrial policy. At the same time, the course highlights the large size of informal markets in land, labor, capital, and information, which spur market-driven economic behavior outside of the industrial policy framework."

To do so the course draws on readings from an interdisciplinary and methodologically diverse body of research on conflicts unfolding across a variety of geographic and cultural contexts.

U.S. public policies based on these theories were deployed both domestically and abroad. The seminar will argue that these two sets of policies—at home and abroad--often draw from similar ideas about hierarchies and categories of human beings; land-use, relations among humans, other living beings, and inanimate earth features; work and livelihoods; gender, race, capacity for self-definition and political self-representation, who should wield power, and so on."

Additionally, we will discuss how multilingualism influences English use in Africa and how English use affects language choice and policy in sectors such as education and governance across the continent. Overall, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic diversity of African Englishes and their impact on language, identity, and policy across the continent."

How do we write about grief that the world doesn't quite accept as grief? How do we use our writing to build a bridge away from isolation, and towards the universal well of compassion for others? In this class, we'll be culturing the pearls of such ambient grief, isolating what we can in order to examine the way ambient grief reshapes our sense of ourselves and sharpens our sense of the world beyond."

This is the confessional novel, the documentary novel, the novel that includes material from other genres of writing and fields of knowledge, the non-narrative novel, the unoriginal novel, the novel that plays with its status as a material object or book. It is possible that no novel exists without its allegedly weak(er) cousins, and that no novel—no matter how big, strong, or novelistic—is without its moments of weakness. We will read such authors as Kathy Acker, Percival Everett, David Foster Wallace, Robert Glück, John Keene, and Eileen Myles and compose our own gloriously “weak” fictions."

As we read works by Albert Camus, Graham Greene, Shusaku Endo, Marilynn Robinson and Ursula Le Guin, among others, we’ll discuss why writers still attend to notions of the sacred and divine decades after “the death of God.”"

Key threads here will be the origins of contemporary surveillance in capitalism, colonialism, and empire. Throughout the semester we will attend to how some are disproportionately targeted according to race, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and citizenship. We will also ask what it means to resist surveillance, with particular attention to surveillance in contemporary visual culture. This entails asking what it means to look back and how not to be seen."

This course will be shaped around two key facets of diagnostics: diagnostics as a media form, and diagnostics a mode of encounter. We will pay close attention to the ways empire, race, gender, sexuality, and ability are intertwined in these discussions, and how we create worlds about our experiences, and the experiences of others."

The aim is to consider such efforts in connection with debates in the fields of Adaptation Studies, structuralism/post structuralism, Classics' “reception studies.” The focus is on adaptation as a site of contestation.

The question “what is it to read?” animates topics such as close and distant reading; ideology and hermeneutics of suspicion; figures of affect, surface, and repair. Inquiries into form highlight defamiliarization and (a)historicism; plasticity and formlessness; aesthetics and heteroglossia; dissensus and engagement. Articulating questions of form with questions reading refocuses our attention on the work of form: form as process, as productive, as reformation. Our course will approach the issues of subjectivity and theoretical objects, ideology and pleasure, new formalisms and the politics of the aesthetic in theoretical work from the twentieth and twentieth century across the disciplines. We will focus both on thinking about “reading for form” and on cognate terms for reader, spectator, user, gamer, reconfiguring our theories of form."

At times, these struggles overlap: when groups seek to overthrow the existing authority and install a more just one in its place. Other times, they diverge: when groups or individuals seize power for their own interests, or seek justice by reforming the existing order (rather than toppling it). These struggles illuminate the shifting material and ideological conditions within the Middle East over the past three centuries or so: in other words, over what are people struggling, and why? By focusing on struggles for power and justice, this course emphasizes the Middle East as a dynamic region shaped by numerous stakeholders and challengers, rather than a space with an essential or homogenous character."

It’s the underbelly of prediction. Despite its obstinance, it's everywhere: musical/critical theories, medical/military practices, pastoral/urban mythologies, and architectural/neurological frameworks. Thinking with noise draws music history, and history history together, as it exposes the stakes of creative practice. This seminar takes up a theoretical and practical/experimental approach to this din that is the discourse around noise, as participants develop noise methodologies as modes of response. Background in music is not required, but a commitment to experimental practice (writing included) is.

    "description": "In recent decades the ideas of structural racism, structural sexism, and structural injustice have come to be common in political thought and discussion. Are these meant to be wrongs of some kind, perhaps moral wrongs? If so, are they wrongs somehow in the social structure itself rather than wrongs by individual agents—in which case, for example, a society can be racist even without any racist individuals? On that view, how are we to understand that idea of a wrong that no one commits? Or, instead, are structural injustices merely certain patterns of wrongs by individuals—in which case the racism of a society would disappear with its last racist? The idea of structural injustice has only been around for about 50 years, and so the philosophical literature is young, and active, and will be the subject matter for this course."

Is it irrational to settle for less now when you could have more later? Is it irrational to intend to do something that you don't believe you'll do? Can it be rational to do what you hope you won't? When is it rational to be random? Is it ever rational to be irrational? Along the way, we will learn bayesian probability theory, decision theory, game theory, and social choice theory."

    "description": "Political philosophy is deeply concerned with just distribution: with what we owe each other and why. One important but subtle area of inquiry focuses not on material distribution – on who gets money and things – but on a hidden economy: an economy of power, status, and esteem. Who in society gets to hold positions of authority and status and why? Who is my superior? Who gets to dominate me? And how do practices of hierarchy and domination bear on my freedom and equality: as a citizen, in the workplace, or even at home? In this class we will read contemporary and classic philosophical work on power, esteem, hierarchy, and domination and we will try, as best we can, to be free."

Developing countries may suffer worse consequences than wealthier countries. At the same time wealthier countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions. Maybe we can mitigate or adapt to climate change, but the question whether we should do something about climate change is an ethical question. The ethical question is complex. Who is morally responsible for climate change? Individuals? States and nations? Can past generations be held responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward future generations? Should all countries bear the burden of climate change equally?"

We examine classic theories of well-being: hedonistic, desire, and eudaimonistic theories, as well as new theoretical options (internalist and constitutivist theories). Then we consider different varieties of prudential goods, including happiness, meaningfulness, achievement. Finally, we look at questions of the proper scope of prudential value, in particular whether it is best understood as a property of a whole life."

We aim to discuss the dialogue in detail and to consider relevant passages in other dialogues, such as perception and judgment in the Theaetetus, falsehood in the Sophist, two arts of measurement in the Statesman, the Good in the Republic, and perception and perceptible qualities in the Timaeus. Our questions include: what method is advocated in the Philebus and how does it relate to similar methods in the Phaedrus, Sophist, and Statesman? Plato’s Socrates plays with the notions of limit, unlimited, mixture, and cause. How do those notions contribute to his investigation of pleasure, knowledge, and the good life?"

And yet, its precise character is a matter of recently growing controversy. Drawing of a mix of historical and contemporary sources, the seminar engages in a close examination of this elusive emotion, paying special attention to ongoing controversies: e.g., Is resentment an essentially moral emotion? Is resentment a form of anger or hatred, or is it significantly different from them? How does resentment compare with ressentiment, a concept made famous by Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Scheler and recently appropriated by social scientists?"

The thesis is the better option for those who want to conduct academic research with a mentor in an independent study-type format, the capstone course is for those who prefer an applied project in a classroom setting. Program Proposal: Students who opt to take this section of the capstone course will craft a grant proposal for a health-promotion or disease-prevention program. The proposal may request funding for the design, implementation, or evaluation of the intervention."

At the center of our exploration stands Reinhold Niebuhr, a towering figure whose profound insights into the complexities of human nature, power, and justice continue to resonate today. Through a sustained reading of Niebuhr, we will uncover the challenges, contradictions, and possibilities that liberal democracy faced during this transformative period in the United States. We will discuss Niebuhr with other defenders of liberalism and its critics: John Dewey, W. E. B. Du Bois, Judith Skhlar, and Isaiah Berlin."

    "description": "For centuries, scholars have looked to religious institutions, theological doctrines, and sacred texts to explain religion’s form and function in culture and society. And while this approach has enabled scholars to neatly prescribe what counts as religious, it’s also caused them to ignore the ways people’s daily faith practices make a mess of this work. Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the “religious” and “non-religious” things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the “sacred” and “profane”."

This course explores the topic of Jewish–Muslim relations from such angles as religion, literature, philosophy, politics, economics, and social life. Some of the contexts and themes we will examine are the following: attitudes toward Jews and Judaism in earliest Islam; the Judeo-Arabic “symbiosis” of the Middle Ages; social developments in the Jewish–Muslim relationship in the Near East and Europe in the early modern period; Jews and Muslims as ethnic and religious minorities in Western countries today; and Islamic life in the State of Israel."

We will discuss how such figures employed conceptions of state, nationalism, secularism, democracy, law, gender, and minority rights to articulate multiple futures for national and global Muslim communities and influenced a variety of popular struggles as well as armed movements. As such, we will think through their intellectual, political, and hermeneutical departures from more traditionalist understandings as a critique of the modern condition and examine the strengths as well as limitations of their ideas and receptions."

Though used for millennia in indigenous ceremonies and religious rites, it is only in the last century that they have played a role in Western science, medicine, and culture. Literally “manifesting the soul,” psychedelics have been both stigmatized and hyped, remaining illegal or controversial in many contemporary contexts even as they are marketed as the “next big thing” in mental health care. This course compares and contrasts the cultural and ontological contexts for psychedelic use from indigenous and religious ceremonies to contemporary scientific clinical trials and neuroscience. Along the way, pressing questions within the psychedelic field will be investigated from an interdisciplinary lens and with an appreciation for history and context."

What are “family values” and where did they come from? What is secularism, and does it promote sexual freedom? This course takes up questions like these, anchoring its inquiry in interdisciplinary feminist theories of gender and sexuality. Linking theoretical texts to a range of grounded contexts—from Court rulings on religious freedom, to fights over sex education in schools, to militarized sexual violence, to capitalism’s regimes of gendered labor—students will develop critical vocabularies for analyzing intimacies between religion, sex, and politics in American empire."

We will ask questions like the following: How can we trace the growth of the idea that participation in global free markets can facilitate relations of justice? What moral frameworks and theories of human life underwrite the vision of capital markets as a theater for political-ethical action? Under what circumstances can capitalist philosophies and practices be understood in terms of religion?"

    "description": "Scholars of race and religion have long understood these categories as co-constitutive--intertwined social concepts that have historically worked in tandem to frame the self and construct, name, and categorize the other. In America, in particular, the very notion of what it means to be American has always rested on racial and religious imaginaries that underpin the discourses, myths, and symbols on which this identity relies and gets articulated. Americanness is as much a descriptor of racial and religious positionality as it is of national identity. This seminar interrogates how race and religion constitute each other in the US context. Reading historical and contemporary scholarship and paying particular attention to themes of gender, sexuality, and empire, we will critically consider how religion and race inflect the social, historical, and cultural projects that shape, contest, and expand our notions of America."

Starting with accounts of observers such as Xuanzang (Chinese pilgrim, 7th century), Ibn Battuta (Persian traveler, 14th century), and Roberto Nobili (Jesuit missionary, 17th century), we examine how anthropology, developing in European colonial contexts, constructed a “religious” subject. How did ritual, magic, belief, and myth come to characterize religions of South Asia? How did “caste” and “idol worship” come to dominate the anthropology of Indian religions? What decolonial approaches are now necessary to challenge European categories and theories of experience which have been presumed to work globally? We consider varieties of ethnographic methods in contemporary ethnographies from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, and also experiment in ethnographic research and writing.

Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them?

Many scientific workers–including translators, activists, archivists, technicians, curators, and ethics review boards–are absent in publications and omitted from stories of discovery. Professional scientists are often celebrated, yet they are expected to uphold principles of ‘objective’ self-denial. This course will explore these silences and omissions to reveal how invisibilities have shaped twentieth and twenty-first century science. The course modules invites comparisons across geographic, temporal, and disciplinary boundaries. The modules also facilitate different forms of self-reflexive practice, and will open the possibilities of research avenues for students; how we should approach research and narrative method; and how contemporary interest in invisible labor relates to established discursive traditions in the historiography of science and STS."

We will situate the social and medical models of the disabled, sick, and fat body within institutions of empire–such as the plantation, camp, and penitentiary) to examine how disability and other forms of bodily difference become scripted within liberal humanism. In doing so, we recast familiar debates in Postcolonial and Decolonial Studies on topics such as sovereignty, ecological extraction, and global capitalism through a Critical Disability Studies lens. Exploring historical and literary texts, films, poetry, embodied performances, and other aesthetic objects, we will identify how shifting formations of colonial and scientific knowledges reverberate onto our contemporary understandings and lived experiences of bodily difference as they are scaffolded through race-gender-labor relations."

The history of colonialism, enslavement, and plantations are also intertwined in ruin of the environment. Feminist science studies provide a guide to the arts of noticing and staying with the troubles of our time but also for imagining otherwise. In this course we gather hope from ecofeminism in order to move towards a justice-oriented future. We do this by delving into the literature on ecofeminism alongside ecological speculative fiction. Recognizing that solutions to environmental problems require a feminist attunement, we can start to understand the implications that our ethical commitments have to the future of life on the planet."

    "description": "Unlike other creative professionals, visual artists don't have agents or managers—you handle the business yourself, with the support of your community. This class covers business basics including tracking inventory and preparing invoices; taking legal precautions such as registering a copyright and drafting consignment forms; using promotional tools; diversifying income; and making career decisions such as choosing the right venues to show your work. We will discuss grants, residencies, budgets, do-it-yourself strategies, financial health, and professional relationships. Discussion and assignments will emphasize community, the sharing of resources, and the practical, hands-on skills necessary to thrive as a visual artist."
